# product-cart
a product cart that was designed with pure HTML and CSS.
This task was given to me in my current Bootcamp I'm in now, you can check the product cart.jpg I commit with this repo to check the original image given to me/us and we were asked to convert it to pure HTML and CSS.its no really easy though but with a collective effort of my fellow devs, we all achieve it together. you can do the comparison and rate the work between 1-10.thanks
