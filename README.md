# product-cart
a product cart which was design with pure html and css.
This task was given to me in my current bootcamp am in now, you can check the product cart.jpg i commit with this repo to check the 
original image given to me/us and we were ask to convert it to pure html and css.its no really easy though but with collective effort
of my fellow devs, we all achieve it together.you can do the comparison and rate the work between 1-10.thanks
